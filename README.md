# STOCKPRICEMOVEMENTANALYSIS_202401100300290
Stock price movement analysis in Python involves processing historical stock data to identify trends and patterns. The script reads a CSV file containing stock prices, calculates daily returns to measure volatility, and applies moving averages (50-day and 200-day) to identify trends. It visualizes stock performance using line charts and histograms to analyze return distributions. Libraries like pandas handle data processing, numpy supports numerical calculations, and matplotlib/seaborn create insightful visualizations. This analysis helps investors understand stock behavior, detect trends, and assess risk. Pythonâ€™s flexibility makes it an ideal tool for financial data analysis and decision-making. ðŸš€
